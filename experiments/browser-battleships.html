          I'd been doing a lot of work with manipulating the browser window, and
          thought about what game (after pong) would be good to translate to
          browser windows.
        </p>
        <p>Battleships was my thinking</p>
        <p>
          A timer counts down and then drops the last browser 'bomb', if one of
          your boats/windows is roughly within the same coordinates, that's a
          hit!
