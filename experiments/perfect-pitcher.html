          A little quiz I devloped for all those people that are able to sing a
          song in the right key, without listening to it first.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the note detection wobbles around quite a lot, I have a volume
          threshold so that anything that is obviously loud gets added to an
          array. Then I select the note that appears the most in order to make
          sure the correct note is taken. I was quite happy with this bit of
          logic
