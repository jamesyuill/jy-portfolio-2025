          I have a backend server that will scrape wikipedia for a text query,
          returning all the images to a Next.js front end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Write 'Cheese' into the search box and it will ping that off to a
          server which dones the scrapping and then sends back the results
        </p>
        <p>
          This was one of my first smaller experiments after completing the
          software developer bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not much time was spent on the way the front end looks by the way!
          Probably spent as much time finding that loading pug gif than I did
          css styling!
