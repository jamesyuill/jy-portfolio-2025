          I love the music of Jackson and His Computer Band. This French
          producer spends years building epic sounding tracks from microsamples.
          I wondered if there was a way of collecting microsamples using my
          python coding skills. Yes there is/was.
        </p>
        <p>
          It works by prompting the user to input a search query. One word will
          do. This is used to generate a results page in youtube of all the
          videos for that query. I then ask the user to pick a number between
          1-10. This relates to the number of video results on the first page.
          After some functions run, it spits out a handful of microsamples.
        </p>
        <p>
          The flow is as follows. Selenium spins up a headless chrome browser.
          pops the search term at the end of the youtube results domain.
          Beautiful Soup then grabs all the video src links and based on the
          number input by the user, selects one from the list. The video is then
          downloaded, converted to audio and then the Librosa library leaps into
          action. Analysing the bpm and then cutting a few little pieces
          randomly out of the audio. It then saves these into a folder for me to
          listen to and keep or delete.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would love to integrate this into Ableton Live, but that might be a
          bit too far away from me at the moment
