          This was one of the first projects where I really got to grips with
          Object Oriented Programming
        </p>
        <p>I had the idea and decdided to see if I could do it</p>
        <p>
          I used Three.js for the visuals (obvs) and Tone.js for the audio
          elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim was to get a visual representation of a bouncing ball, but
          once I'd built one ball, I then wanted to generate more. I refactored
          the bouncing ball as an extended class with it's own methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to add the ability for a user to upload an audio clip and
          for that to be used. Maybe even to split the sounds up over the number
          of balls.
        </p>
        <p>
          So basically, it's not really finished, but I'm betting you probably
          have a tonne of projects you'd love to expand upon. If only these
          other ideas that keep popping up would just chill out for a bit!
