          I built this using Puppeteer for the web scraping and
          Instagram-Private-API for the posting.
        </p>

        <p>
          The aim was to automate the task of regularly posting shop items from
          a drop shipping site to Instagram.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scraper is set up on a cron-job, going out twice a day to 'scrape'
          an etsy shop. It grabs the images and the metadata for the item. It
          then will log into an instagram profile and post about a randomly
          chosen item. I varied the types of posts it would spit out. You know,
          to make it a bit less like a robot!
        </p>
        <p>
          Please go and buy something from the site. I think it's only made Â£20
          so far and that was 100% my mum!
