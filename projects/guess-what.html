        <p>Now, this was a fun and frightening project!</p>
        <p>
          Build in around ten days, from inception to demonstration, as part of
          my final software bootcamp project
        </p>
        <p>
          I hasten to add that I did not do this on my own, I had the help of 4
          other amazing programmers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim was simple, make a version of Guess Who, but with aliens. MVP
          was a single player game - which we achieved pretty quickly. Bonus
          would be the multiplayer element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you have to be aware that we had only really been programming in
          anger for about two and a half months. And yes, we had decided to take
          on web sockets. Was it bravado? No reader. It was definitely
          ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting our heads round Socket.io was tough, although it is an amazing
          library for web sockets.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all first attempts there are a lot of things I would go back and
          change, but I'm not going to do that, as it reminds me of a simpler
          time, when 5 very junior devlopers attempted something they had no
          idea about and actually managed to produce something that wasn't
          entirely bad!
