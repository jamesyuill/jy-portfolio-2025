          Here we are, back at one of the very first protfolio sites I made
          directly after completing my software bootcamp.

          I'd been messing around with Three.js for a while, but had fallen in
          love with the React way of making reusable components. I came across
          React Three/Fiber and React Three/Drei and knew that I wanted to make
          my portfolio using these libraries.

        <p>It's a very simple canvas with a React website on top.</p>
