        <p>2024's attempt at a minimal and simple site.</p>
        <p>
          I used Next.js for this, because everyone was raving about it at the
          time!
        </p>
        <p>
          I immediately hit a brick wall with that front page and it's svg
          animations
        </p>
        <p>
          If you didn't know, Next offers the ability to render components on
          the server which means faster loading times. Somthing like that!
          Anyway, the problem was that in order for the svgs to be
          programmatically inserted on the dom window, I needed the dom window
          to exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I did something like, setting the state of the window to
          undefined and then putting that in a useEffect so that when it mounts
          we then set the innerWidth and innerHeights. Basically, I thinnk it
          was a pretty hacky way of doing it, and I've never been happy with the
          delay that you get when loading the index page. Needless to say, it
          was seemless in my local environment!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm happy with how minimal the site was, but it was still too bloated
          for my liking, hence me rebuilding my site again...ie...what you're
          looking at right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been doing a lot of vanilla Javascript projects recently. Browser
          manipulation, svg work (okay..using D3, but it feels the same, plus
          I'm using it via a cdn so not super bloated!)
