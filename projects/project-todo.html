          This is a project I build to get me familiar with NextAuth and
          creating a signup/login style dashboard. It's also a project where I
          used Typescript within Next.js for the first time.

          I love everything about these kanban style websites. I use Trello in
          my personal life! So for me the goal was to create a collection of
          todo lists that could be moved around including the items inside. So
          you can move one todo item into another collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The drag and drop functionality took a bit of time to solve just
          because there are a few libraries that one can use. I opted for
          Beautiful React DnD.
        </p>
        I used MongoDB to store the username data and the todo list data
        <p>
          You'll notice that this is not deployed yet as it's very much a work
          in progress. It's not super responsive. I also need to set up a
          default log in for people just browsing. In fact, I also need a seed
          function for the data too. I can imagine when I host it people will be
          deleting things left, right and centre! I can only imagine what crazy
          things people will add to do!
