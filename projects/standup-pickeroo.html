          Another work project. This was designed with the sole purpose of being
          able to randomly pick people to talk at our standups
        </p>
        <p>Vanilla Javascript, nothing fancy</p>
        <p>
          I have an animation loop that (when a boolean is true, ie isSpinning)
          will cycle through the names of the list.
        </p>
        <p>
          The slowing down is achieved by counting the frames through every loop
          of the animate function. When the remainder of the 'frames modulo
          variable is equal to 0' then it changes the value of that variable
          making the time steps greater
        </p>
        <p>
          I really don't think I explained it well so defo check out the github
          if you're at all interested
