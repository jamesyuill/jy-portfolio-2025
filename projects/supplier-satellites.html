        <p>
          In my current role, I have had the opportunity to design and build a
          custom visual for Power BI.
        </p>

        <p>
          I used the microsoft library pbiviz to set this up. It's a bit
          tricky,especially when you don't have admin rights to your laptop! The
          library creates an SSL certificate so that you can spin up a local
          server and have the power bi browser version officially trust it
          enough to let you enable developer mode.
        </p>

        <p>
          After managing to get my environment set up, it was quite straight
          forward as the Power BI window is essentially a browser window. So all
          the usual methods exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          I played around doing some usual DOM manipulations first. I knew I
          needed a search box, so I created that and the simple funcitonality to
          search from an array of options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using D3.js (which is an amazing library for working with svgs, I
          created the rough demo.)
