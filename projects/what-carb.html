          Like any real software engineer will tell you, "you always start with
          a recipe app". You know why? It's because it requires working with
          data in an easy 'consumable' (...nudge nudge) way.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're anything like me, you will pick your meals based on the
          sheer volume of carbs it allows you to consume
        </p>
        <p>
          So the most frequent question in our house is, "What carb do you want
          tonight?". A close second being "Are you sure that's a healthy amount
          of carbs?!"
        </p>
        <p>And so, What Carb? was born</p>
        <p>
          I use MongoDB for the database, and React for the front end. It's a
          very basic MERN app with CRUD capabilites. If you don't know what that
          is google it!
